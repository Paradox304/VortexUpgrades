# VortexUpgrades
##### How it works:
You can set a gun that can be upgraded, with the guns that it can be upgraded to or downgraded to. If for example, the player is unlucky and the gun can't be downgraded or upgraded to the gun will be lost by the player and the amount will be charged. Chance can be 1-100 with 100 being like definitive success.

You can set the cost of the upgrade as well. The gun that it will be upgraded or downgraded to will be chosen on random within the list.

##### Commands:
/checkupgrade (Gun Name/Gun ID) = Check if the gun can be upgraded and for how much and what is the chance on it. (Permission: checkupgrade)
/upgrade (Gun Name/Gun ID) = Upgrade your gun. (Permission: upgrade)
